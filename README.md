#Introduction

In this repo you'll find some sample sketched to get you up and running with the SKAARHOJ Arduino library.

If you are thinking about building your own hardware panel, then this is a good place to start!

Also, be sure to keep up to date with your Arudino libraries over on [The official SKAARHOJ repo](https://github.com/kasperskaarhoj/SKAARHOJ-Open-Engineering)
